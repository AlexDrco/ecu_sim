# Arduino ECU Simulator

A simulated Engine Control Unit (ECU) for Arduino using a CAN Bus shield to mimic responses to OBD-II commands.


## Features

- **Simulate OBD-II Commands**: Respond to PIDs (Parameter IDs) commonly used in automotive diagnostics.
- **CAN Bus Communication**: Utilize the Arduino CAN Bus shield to communicate like a real ECU.
- **Customizable Responses**: Easily tweak the code to mimic different engine conditions or faults.
- **Educational Tool**: Great for learning OBD-II protocols or testing diagnostic tools.

OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics II) allows for standardized diagnostics of automotive systems. This simulator aims to replicate those diagnostics for educational or development purposes.

> "This ECU simulator provides a bridge between theoretical knowledge of automotive electronics and practical application."


## Tech Stack

This project uses a blend of technologies to simulate an ECU:

- **Arduino IDE** - Development environment for Arduino.
- **CAN Bus Shield** - For Arduino to communicate via CAN protocol.
- **Serial Communication** - For debugging and monitoring the Arduino's behavior.


## Usage

To set up your Arduino CAN ECU Simulator:

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect your Arduino to the CAN Bus shield.
   - Ensure all wiring is correct according to the shield's documentation.
   

2. **Software**:

   - Open in Arduino IDE
   - Install Seeduino Can Bus library
